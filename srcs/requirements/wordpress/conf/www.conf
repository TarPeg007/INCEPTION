; 1. PROCESS IDENTITY (Crucial for Debian)
; Must match the user we chown files to in install.sh
user = www-data
group = www-data

; 2. NETWORK CONNECTION (Crucial for Docker)

; Default Debian config uses a socket file which won't work here.
listen = 9000

; 3. PROCESS MANAGER
; Required to spawn worker processes to handle traffic.
